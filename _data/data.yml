      - title: Face generator
        link: "https://github.com/omkarpat/deep-learning/blob/master/face_generation/dlnd_face_generation.ipynb"
        tagline: "Trained a generative adversarial network using tensorflow to generate new faces from celebA database. Languages/Frameworks used: Python, Tensorflow, Jupyter Notebook"

      - title: Content-based audio auto-tagger using deep learning
        link: "https://github.com/Rashmeet09/AutoTaggingAudios_DeepLearning"
        tagline: "Tackled the multi-label classification problem of accurate prediction of tages for audios. The experiment was performed on MagnaTagATune (MTT) dataset using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN). An AUC-ROC score of 0.886 was achieved. 40 fixed tags in emotions, instruments, genre could then predicted for new tracks."

      - title: Neural network from scratch
        link: "https://github.com/omkarpat/Deep-Learning-NanoDegree/tree/master/dlnd-your-first-network"
        tagline: "Developed a complete neural network from scratch using numpy to understand the fundamentals .Implemented the Forward and Backword Propogation passes, wrote my own implementation of sigmoid which was used as an activation function and trained the network on bike dataset to find the optimum number of bikes required each day. Tweaked the hyper-parameters to understand the variations and effects on the accuracy of the network."

      - title: Meta-App | A framework for incognito mode for smartphone applications
        link: "https://github.com/omkarpat/metaapp"
        tagline: "An Intent Publishing solution which can be used by the user to request offers from dealers anonymously."

      - title: Centralized student database
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Setup a Hadoop cluster to act as a centralized location to store student information (attendance, marks and teachers' recommendations and comments about the student) in JSON objects. It could be useful when student is switching classes or schools to convey a better student profile over traditional quantitative attributes."
